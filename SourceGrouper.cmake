#This cmake script should help those people, who search for a nice
#way to group up source files according to their paths in envoirments with filters e.g. Visual Studio.

#provides 2 cmake functions:
# groups_sources : takes a list of sources as an argument. The sources will be grouped together
# group_target_sources: takes a target as an argument. The sources of this target will be grouped together

#groups sources passed to the function according to the directory of the source tree
#therefore, the CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR will be stripped. The relative path will be the group
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0.0)

	foreach(f ${ARGN})
		get_filename_component(abs_path ${f} REALPATH )
		get_filename_component(filename ${f} NAME )
		string (REPLACE ${filename} "" abs_path ${abs_path})
		source_group("" FILES ${f})
		if(abs_path)
            #strip of the cmake source dir
			string(REPLACE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} "Generated Files" rel_path ${abs_path}) #in case of generated files
			string(REPLACE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} "" rel_path ${rel_path})
